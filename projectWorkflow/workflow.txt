Setup Notes:

index.html will contain the home layout with embedded or modular sections

script.js manages DOM interactivity, event listeners, and local storage state

Styling Recommendations:

Use CSS variables for colors (e.g., --primary, --muted, --accent)

Dark mode toggle using class="dark" on <body>

Font: Use a readable sans-serif like 'Inter' or 'Poppins'

Box shadows, hover transitions, and border-radius (8–16px) for smooth visuals

Flexbox & Grid for layouts
