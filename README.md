# Thoughty

Thoughty is a platform for sharing ideas of the youth with people and entrepreneurs across the world with the ability to clone ideas to other verses (Clone different version of the same idea using AI), Selling the idea at some point, or find investors.

I was responsible for the initial vanilla frontend, then later it was converted to React!

## Features:

* **Thoughty Pods** that allows the user to share as much ideas as they want at any stage.
* User can battle with their ideas to see how much votes would it get.
* **Gamification Engine** which counts a mind tokens for the user and score them up.
* **Brainstorm Roulette & Multiverse** allows the user to have a creative AI thinker to help them with their ideas or to help somebody creating the same idea in another verse âœ¨
* **Mind Mentor** that tracks user thoughts and ideas and help them get improving using AI and suggest for them books to read and create reports for them.
